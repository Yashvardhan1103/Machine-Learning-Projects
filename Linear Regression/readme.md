## **Overview**
This Jupyter Notebook implements a linear regression machine learning model to train on a dataset and make predictions. The model goes through key steps such as **data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization of predictions**.

## **Key Features**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Loads and prepares the dataset.
- **Model Initialization:** Defines the model and sets up initial parameters.
- **Training the Model:** Updates weights and biases using gradient descent.
- **Evaluation & Predictions:** Compares trained vs. untrained model predictions.
- **Visualization:** Plots predictions against actual values to assess model performance.

## **Requirements**
To run this notebook, install the necessary dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## **How to Use**
1. **Load the Dataset:** The notebook reads input data and preprocesses it.
2. **Train the Model:** The model learns from the training data.
3. **Make Predictions:** The trained model predicts outcomes.
4. **Evaluate Performance:** Visualize results and compare trained vs. untrained predictions.

## **Visualization**
The final plot compares:
- **Red crosses ('rx')**: Predictions from the **untrained** model.
- **Blue dots ('b.')**: Predictions from the **trained** model.

## **Next Steps**
- Tune hyperparameters for better accuracy.
- Experiment with different loss functions.
- Implement **incremental learning** for real-time updates.
